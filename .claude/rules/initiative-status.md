# Initiative Status — Live Coordination State

**Last verified:** 2026-07-30 · This is the ONE always-loaded file recording what is currently in
flight, leased, or unapplied. Full initiative manifests live in `docs/archive/rules/` — they are
history, not law. When an initiative completes, delete its row here; when one starts, add a row
and a roadmap. Do not let this file grow past ~1 page — that is how the last rulebook died.

## Active leases (check before touching a shared hotspot)

**None.** No file or seam in this repository is currently under a sole-writer lease.

*(Released 2026-07-29: the mobile current-origin reconciliation lease over `.claude/**`,
`AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `tooling/**` and the mobile integration seams — owner accepted the
handback. Its work landed in `dev` via PR #525, merged 2026-07-27; the holder branch
`codex/mobile-readiness-current-origin-review` had zero commits not already in `dev` at
acceptance.)*

The 2026-07-27 `dev → main` promotion hold is **RELEASED** (owner-authorized). Promote from a
quiet `dev` and re-check `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...origin/dev` immediately
before promoting.

## Authored but NOT applied to the shared database

- **`20260730150000_oop_pricing_builder.sql`** (authored 2026-07-30) — adds private, forced-RLS
  pricing revision/audit/save-request/snapshot tables plus admin-gated configuration and
  role-gated calculator RPCs. It does not change `oop_quotes` columns or table grants; it replaces
  the broad authenticated policies with the same exact role-and-rollout predicate used by the RPCs.
  Calculator access is exactly active internal `admin`, `office`, `supervisor`, `estimator` (sales
  rep), and `project_manager`; those roles may access all OOP quotes company-wide. `field_tech`,
  `crm_partner`/external, inactive, unsupported, and unauthenticated actors are denied. Its paired
  rollback is owner-GUC-gated and retains the private data inert. Applying any of these migrations
  to the shared project remains a separate owner-authorized release window; repository or frontend
  work does not make this schema live.
- **`20260730170000_device_token_apns_topic.sql`** (authored 2026-07-30, this session) — per-token
  APNs topic: additive `device_tokens.apns_topic` + a DEFAULT-preserving replace of
  `upsert_my_native_device_token` (2-param → single 3-param function; deployed caller keeps
  resolving). It also removes the lingering authenticated SELECT policy from the raw-token table;
  browser table privileges were already revoked, and checked-in clients use only the selector-free
  RPCs. Paired rollback + CI contract test + behavioral db-lane test
  (`supabase/tests/device_token_apns_topic_isolated.sql` — apply-window proof, NOT CI coverage)
  committed alongside. **Sequencing: apply BEFORE the
  companion worker/client code deploys** — `apns.js` selects the new column and the client passes the
  new param, so code-first deployment breaks push lookup (`token_lookup_failed`) and native
  enrollment (PGRST202). Kills the wrong-topic failure mode behind the 2026-07-30 push outage; the
  Preview `APNS_TOPIC` flip planned for the dev app is superseded and must not be made
  (`docs/mobile/push-activation-owner-gate.md`).
- **`20260730214500_pg_net_worker_url_allowlists.sql`** (authored 2026-07-30) — body replacements
  of `notify_emit` + `notify_google_calendar_sync` adding the two-URL allowlist the wake functions
  already carry, plus a blank-secret no-op. Both definers become service-role-only; repository
  caller tracing found the calendar notifier is reached only by owner-executed database triggers,
  never by a browser. Paired rollback + CI contract test committed.
  Reviewer advisory satisfied by live evidence 2026-07-30: `gcal_worker_url` and `notify_worker_url`
  both read exactly `https://utahpros.app/api/...` live, so the new gate will not no-op them.
- **`20260731100000_transcribe_call_cron_allowlist.sql`** (authored 2026-07-31) — closes the
  20260730214500 DEFERRED item, the last config-driven pg_net caller with no allowlist: the two
  transcribe-call pg_cron commands move into zero-grant SECURITY DEFINER wake functions carrying
  the exact two-URL allowlist + blank-secret no-op; job names, schedules and payloads unchanged.
  Paired rollback (restores the 20260722 inlined commands, then drops the functions) + CI contract
  test (`tests/qa/unit/transcribe-call-cron-allowlist.test.js`) + apply-window check
  (`supabase/tests/transcribe_call_cron_allowlist_post_apply.sql`) committed. No code-deploy
  sequencing; before applying, confirm live `transcribe_call_worker_url` still reads
  `https://utahpros.app/api/transcribe-call` (registry ops check) — off-allowlist values fail
  closed and would silently stop the safety nets.
  No sequencing dependency; apply in any window. Ops registry:
  `docs/database/integration-config-worker-urls.md`.

Both formerly-pending migrations applied 2026-07-30 under explicit owner authorization:

- `20260729220000_tech_onboarding_state.sql` → live ledger `20260730115220`. Postconditions and an
  independent check passed (RLS enabled+forced, no browser-role table grant, `anon` EXECUTE false on
  both definer RPCs). The first-run tour is live; verified rendering all three screens.
- `20260728000000_sms_consent_opt_out_only.sql` → live ledger `20260730121811`. Its drift guard
  passed before replacement; live body still carries the DND, explicit-opt-out and pending-STOP
  refusals, and the function stays `service_role`-only. Opt-out-only is live for staff 1:1 only.
  Detail + rollback posture: `.claude/rules/sms-experience-wave-ownership.md` §13.

## CRM lead value (2026-07-30, owner-directed standalone) — APPLIED

`20260730133000_crm_lead_value_from_claim.sql` → live ledger **`20260730155213`**. Proven on the
`qa-staging` branch first (all 7 behavioural scenarios PASS, including the multi-job sum), then
applied to production with 13 postconditions verified: 6 functions, `anon` EXECUTE false on every
one, both constraints validated, 3 triggers, the invoice trigger watching all 7 decision columns,
Won auto-advance preserved, and `crm_sync_lead_value` still present but unwired.

**The staging run earned its keep:** it caught `crm_backfill_lead_values` granted to `anon` (a
transcription slip in the apply payload, not in the reviewed file) plus two defects in the
behavioural test's fixtures. Apply the reviewed FILE, not a retyped copy.

Staff can type a lead's value by hand, and it
otherwise fills itself from billing: **the SUM of every committed invoice across ALL jobs under the
lead's claim** (88 of 157 claims have more than one job, so multi-job is the normal case).

- **This replaced a feature that was live but dead.** `20260721_crm_lead_value_sync.sql` had been
  applied for nine days and never ran once — 0 `crm_lead_value_synced` events, 0 of 156 leads valued
  — because its trigger was `AFTER INSERT ON invoices` gated on `total > 0`, while every invoice is
  inserted with no total and gets one later by UPDATE. The new trigger's `UPDATE OF` list names every
  column the calculation reads, and a CI test fails if that list and the calculation drift apart.
- **Owner rules:** a draft never counts; sent / QBO-emailed / converted-from-estimate / has-a-payment
  all do. The payment arm carries the rule (71 invoices have a payment vs 9 emailed, 4 from an
  estimate). A human-set value is never overwritten (`inbound_leads.value_source`).
- **Multi-tenant seam:** `claims`/`jobs`/`invoices`/`contacts` carry no `org_id` (only the CRM tables
  do), so the lead is the org anchor and the whole claim→jobs→invoices join lives in ONE function,
  `crm_lead_claim_value()`. Add the tenant predicate there when billing gains `org_id`.
- **Backfill RUN 2026-07-30 under explicit owner authorization**, 30-day window. Result: 12 leads
  attached to a single unambiguous claim (a 13th was already attached by the live trigger), **2 leads
  valued — $15,626.22 and $10,538.19 = $26,164.41** — matching the read-only dry run to the cent.
  0 failures, 0 manual values touched. Both figures independently reconciled against their claims'
  invoices; the $15,626.22 one sums **2 invoices across 2 jobs**, which is the multi-job case this
  feature exists for. Only 2 of 61 board leads valued because 41 have no claim yet — billing lags the
  call, and the triggers pick those up automatically as invoices are sent or paid.
  - Run as service role, because `crm_backfill_lead_values` gates on an active admin **session** and
    `auth.uid()` is NULL outside one (gate verified to fail closed). Scope was identical to that
    function. Attachments are audited as `crm_lead_claim_attached_backfill` — a distinct event type,
    so a backfill attachment is never mistaken for the claim-created trigger's own.
  - **To undo:** `UPDATE inbound_leads SET value = NULL WHERE value_source = 'auto';` and clear
    `claim_id` for the ids in the `crm_lead_claim_attached_backfill` events.
- Superseded `crm_sync_lead_value` is left in place, unreferenced — it is granted to `authenticated`,
  and dropping a live function is the contract removal `database-standard.md` §3 forbids.
- History for the completed CRM wave stays in `docs/archive/rules/crm-wave-ownership.md`; this entry
  is the live record. Delete it once the feature has baked.

## Standing operational state

- **Consent model:** opt-out-only for staff 1:1 service SMS + named typed transactional notices;
  everything automated/bulk/marketing is global-opt-in-only. Authority:
  `.claude/rules/sms-experience-wave-ownership.md` §13 (kept in place — a CI contract test reads
  it).
- **Staging database:** Supabase branch `qa-staging` (ref `uizgwvkvzyldystqrcsk`) — **SEEDED
  2026-07-29, parity-verified, CI db lane LIVE** (details: `docs/database/staging-branch-runbook.md`).
  The only hosted DB agents may iterate against. Open tail: test-fixture seed to retire the
  shrink-only failure baseline (`scripts/qa/db-lane-baseline.json`).
- **A2P / live sends / provider webhooks / feature-flag flips:** owner-gated, always.

## Phase-scoped conversations — OPEN QUESTION, no owner decision yet (raised 2026-07-30)

**Do not build any of this until the owner chooses a direction.**

**The problem (owner-stated, real):** one customer thread mixes three phases of the
relationship, and the wrong people see the wrong things. Sales negotiates pricing with a
lead; technicians then text the same customer about mitigation work and can read the sales
history. A customer asking for another quote pings the technician's phone. Months later
Marcelo/owner/Ben handle reconstruction — and mitigation technicians, long since finished,
still get notified about a project that is no longer theirs.

**Owner's proposal:** three phone numbers and three inboxes (sales / mitigation /
reconstruction), with per-inbox access so technicians only reach mitigation. A variant
considered and set aside: group texting, which needs RCS and cannot express the access
rules anyway.

**Counter-argument recorded (so this is not re-derived from zero):**
- Three numbers move the misrouting onto the customer, who cannot know the org chart. They
  save one number and text it forever.
- **STOP becomes legally ambiguous.** Consent keys on the contact's phone
  (`get_service_sms_consent_status`), not on which UPR number was texted. A STOP to the
  sales number either stops everything (so why three?) or is scoped per number, which is
  real TCPA risk at per-message penalties.
- Triples the A2P registration surface, which is already owner-gated and pending.
- Group chat is strictly worse: it puts access control inside the customer's phone, where
  a technician can never be removed from a thread.
- **The `conversations` table already carries `job_phase_context`, `job_id`, `assigned_to`
  and a per-conversation `twilio_number`** — phase-scoped threads with phase-derived access
  and notification audience are mostly a finishing job, not a rewrite. Notification audience
  by phase mirrors what `appointment_crew` already does for appointment Push.
- Inbound routing is the genuinely hard part either way (which thread does a reply join?),
  and needs a staff "move to…" control regardless of how many numbers exist — which is the
  argument that the extra numbers buy little.
- A second number **is** defensible for marketing-vs-service (different compliance class,
  different carrier treatment), but not for mitigation-vs-reconstruction, which is the same
  compliance class and the same project.

**Status:** the owner has heard the counter-argument and has NOT decided. When they do, this
is `/masterplan` work — it touches consent, notification audience, RLS and the inbox UI.
