# UPR Billing · Invoicing · A/R · QuickBooks · Stripe — Handoff & Status
**Last updated:** 2026-06-20 · **Branches:** `dev` has A (+New-invoice picker) + Stripe S3 (dormant); `main` not yet synced (both auto-deploy via Cloudflare Pages) · **Supabase project:** `glsmljpabrwonfiltiqm`

> **READ THIS FIRST if you're a new chat picking up this work.** This is the complete brief
> for the billing/invoicing/A/R + QuickBooks + Stripe initiative. **Do not change the locked
> strategy/design in §1** — it was decided deliberately with the owner (Moroni). Read order:
> **(1) this file → (2) `CLAUDE.md` (project rules) → (3) `UPR-Web-Context.md` (full technical
> reference).** `QBO-PHASE-2-PLAN.md` is an older inbound-sync plan that is **superseded** (we
> went one-way) — ignore except for history. Work on `dev`; keep `main` in sync when asked.

## 1. LOCKED strategy & design (do not re-litigate)

**Integration direction — ONE-WAY, UPR → QuickBooks.** UPR is the system of record; QBO is a
downstream mirror. Everything (invoices *and* payments) is entered in UPR and pushed to QBO.
**Nobody enters/edits invoices or payments directly in QuickBooks.** No inbound/QBO-webhook
sync (that earlier plan was dropped). This is how Housecall Pro / Albiware work.

**Invoicing**
- **One invoice per job (= per division).** A claim with Mitigation + Reconstruction = 2 jobs = 2 invoices. Driven by `create_invoice_for_job(p_job_id)` (returns the existing invoice if one exists — never duplicates).
- **Builder-only, line-item invoices.** No lump-sum amount field. Each line carries a **QBO Item + Class** (per-line class), description, qty × rate. Invoice total rolls up from lines via the `recompute_invoice_from_lines()` trigger.
- **Itemized push:** each line → a QBO `SalesItemLine` with `ItemRef` + `ClassRef`. The Item/Class dropdowns are pulled **live from QBO** via `qbo-query` (UPR mirrors the QBO catalog — they keep ~5–6 items in both).
- **Invoice building happens on a dedicated page** `/invoices/:invoiceId` (`InvoiceEditor`) — intentional/guarded, like QBO/HCP. NOT inline.

**Payments**
- Entered in UPR → pushed to QBO via `qbo-payment` worker as a **Payment applied to the invoice**. Recording is a **quick inline action** on the A/R panel (amount, date, payer, method, reference).
- The `update_invoice_paid` trigger rolls payments up into `invoices.amount_paid`/`status`/`paid_at` AND `jobs.collected_value`/`ar_status`.

**A/R surfaces (all invoice-centric, all share the same components)**
- **Claim page → "Invoices & Payments"** (`ClaimBilling`): per-invoice sent/aging/collected/balance + read-only line summary + payment history + record-payment; "Create/Edit invoice" opens the editor.
- **Customer profile → Financial tab**: same `ClaimBilling` panel fed all the client's jobs (client-level Invoiced/Collected/Balance).
- **Collections hub** (`/collections`): two tabs — **A/R · Outstanding** (`ARDashboard`: KPIs, aging buckets Current/1-30/31-60/61-90/90+, overdue worklist) and **Payments** (`PaymentsLedger`: cash-in history). Rows drill to the per-claim workspace.
- **Per-claim A/R workspace** (`/collections/:claimId`, `ClaimCollectionPage`): client/carrier header, contact quick-actions, A/R KPIs, and the `ClaimBilling` panel for the whole claim.

**Safeguards** (UI-level today; deeper RLS/RPC enforcement is a TODO)
- Master switch: feature flag **`feature:billing`** (enabled). Off = Billing hidden for all; `dev_only_user_id` limits to one person.
- Edit gate: **`canEditBilling(role)` = admin + manager only** (in `src/lib/claimUtils.js`). Used for Billing edits AND Collections A/R edits.
- Two-click confirms on destructive actions (Remove from QuickBooks, Delete draft, delete payment).

**Card processing = Stripe** (decided). Pattern (matches HCP):
- Customer pays via UPR pay-link → UPR records the payment → UPR pushes to QBO. The only "inbound" is Stripe's payment-confirmation webhook (not QBO).
- **Fee automation via a "Stripe clearing" QBO account:** record the **gross** Payment deposited to the clearing account, book the **exact fee** (from Stripe's `balance_transaction.fee`) as a Merchant-Fees expense from the clearing account, and on payout record a **Transfer** of the net to the real bank. Clearing account self-zeroes; bank reconciles exactly.
- **Same-day deposit = Stripe Instant Payouts**, exposed as an in-app button (~1.5% fee).
- **Payout destinations are selectable in Payment Settings** — the **checking account** for standard deposits and the **debit card** for instant payouts — chosen from the Stripe account's existing external accounts. *Adding* a new bank/card happens via Stripe's hosted flow / Dashboard (Financial Connections), never raw bank/card entry in UPR (PCI/compliance). UPR only **lists + selects**.
- **UPR is the ONLY writer to QBO** — do NOT also run Stripe's QBO connector/Synder (would double-post).

**Design conventions to match** (so new work looks native): React 19 + Vite, JSX only; styling = inline styles using CSS custom properties from `index.css` (no Tailwind); `const { db } = useAuth()` for data; `db.rpc()` for new tables; toasts via `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('upr:toast', …))` (never alert/confirm); inline two-click confirms for destructive actions; dedicated pages for heavy/guarded flows (invoice building), inline for quick actions (payments).

## 2. DONE — live on `dev` & `main`

**QBO connection & customers** (pre-existing): OAuth (`quickbooks-connect`/`-callback`, tokens in `integration_credentials`); customer create/link on new contact (`qbo-sync-customer`, AFTER INSERT trigger; one-way create-only).

**Invoicing → QBO**
- Create draft per job (`create_invoice_for_job`), itemized push/update/delete (`qbo-invoice` worker + `lib/quickbooks.js`: `createInvoice`/`updateInvoice`/`deleteInvoice`). Division→Item/Class map in `divisionToQbo`.
- **Auto-stamp** `sent_at` + Net-30 `due_date` on first push (drives aging).
- **Full line-item builder** on the dedicated **`/invoices/:id`** editor (`InvoiceEditor`): Item+Class per line, qty×rate, auto-save, Send/Update to QBO, Remove (confirm), Delete-draft (confirm). `invoice_line_items.qbo_item_id/qbo_item_name/qbo_class_id/qbo_class_name` + `recompute_invoice_from_lines()` trigger.

**Payments → QBO** (one-way): `qbo-payment` worker + `createPayment`/`deletePayment`; `payments.qbo_payment_id/qbo_synced_at/qbo_sync_error`; recorded inline on `ClaimBilling`, applied to the QBO invoice; `update_invoice_paid` rollup.

**A/R surfaces:** claim "Invoices & Payments" panel, customer Financial tab, Collections hub (A/R + Payments tabs), per-claim workspace — all invoice-centric (see §1). Dashboard reads `get_job_financials` / `get_ar_invoices`; ledger reads `get_payments_ledger`.

**Safeguards:** `feature:billing` flag, `canEditBilling` (admin+manager), two-click confirms.

**Payment Settings** (`/payments/settings`, from Collections ⚙): accept card/ACH, default terms, card surcharge %, **QBO fee-account mapping** (Stripe clearing + Merchant Fees, via "Load accounts from QuickBooks"); Stripe connect status + Instant-Payout button present but **inert until Stripe keys exist**. Persisted via `get_billing_settings`/`set_billing_setting` (whitelisted).

**Employee docs:** in-app **Help** page (`/help`), `UPR-Invoicing-Financials-Employee-Guide.md`, downloadable `public/UPR-Invoicing-Financials-Guide.pdf` (regen via `scripts/build-invoicing-guide-pdf.py`). ⚠️ These describe the *pre-builder* flow ("Save amount / Push") — **update them** to the line-item builder + dedicated editor when convenient.

**"+ New invoice" job picker** (Jun 20 2026): shared `NewInvoiceModal` → idempotent `create_invoice_for_job` → `/invoices/:id`. Customer page header button (customer-scoped, reuses loaded claims) + global **+ New invoice** on the Collections header (customer typeahead → claims→jobs). Rows badge "Has invoice"/"New". Gated `feature:billing` + `canEditBilling`.

**Stripe S3 — card collection + fee automation (Jun 20 2026, BUILT but DORMANT):** full code shipped, inert until `STRIPE_*` keys exist (workers 503; UI shows "not set up yet"). Migration `20260620_stripe_s3.sql` **applied** (invoice pay-link cols; payments `source`/`stripe_*`/fee cols + charge-unique index; `stripe_events` RLS-locked idempotency ledger + `claim_stripe_event`; `qbo_bank_account` + Stripe payout-destination keys in billing settings). `functions/lib/stripe.js` (signature verify, balance_transaction, Checkout, external accounts, instant payout). `quickbooks.js` extended (`createPayment` `depositAccountId`; new `createPurchase`/`createTransfer`/`deleteEntity`). Workers: `stripe-webhook` (payment_intent.succeeded → gross payment deposited to clearing + fee Purchase; payout.paid → net Transfer), `stripe-pay-link`, `stripe-payout`, `stripe-accounts`. UI: pay-link on `InvoiceEditor`; payout-destination selectors + live Instant Payout + QBO deposit-bank selector on `PaymentSettings`. **Needs owner setup + live test — see §4.**

**Cleanup done:** removed the old job-centric `ARPage` cluster + stale `COLLECTIONS_*.md`. Legacy `billing_overview` view + `get_ar_jobs` RPC remain in the DB (harmless, unused) — drop later if desired.

## 3. NEXT

**A) "+ New invoice" with job picker — ✅ DONE (Jun 20 2026).** Shipped on `dev` (see §2). Customer-page + Collections entry points; idempotent `create_invoice_for_job` → `/invoices/:id`.

**B) Stripe S3 — ✅ CODE DONE / DORMANT (Jun 20 2026).** Built and applied (see §2). **Remaining = owner activation, not code:** do the §4 setup checklist (Stripe keys + QBO accounts + webhook), then run the live test. Until then it's inert.

**C) Stripe S4 — refunds/disputes** → reverse the payment (+ fee) in QBO on `charge.refunded` / `charge.dispute.created`.

**D) Remaining / polish**
- Flip `integration_config.auto_draft_invoices` → `'true'` after a real prod test (auto-creates a draft per job).
- **Deeper security:** RLS / RPC role checks on financial tables (safeguards are UI-level today).
- Customer-edit → QBO push (e.g. email change; today contact edits don't sync to QBO — create-only).
- `invoice_adjustments` UI (supplements/denials — table exists, unused).
- Update the employee guide/PDF/Help to the builder flow.
- Drop deprecated `billing_overview` / `get_ar_jobs` once confident.

## 4. Stripe S3 — ACTIVATION click-path (code is built & dormant)

The code (workers, lib, migration, UI) is shipped and inert. To turn it on, do the
setup below. Test on **dev** first (`dev.utahpros.app`, Cloudflare **Preview** env,
Stripe **test mode**); repeat for **main**/Production with live keys.

**1 — Stripe keys.** Stripe Dashboard (Test mode) → **Developers → API keys** → copy the
**Publishable** (`pk_test_…`) and **Secret** (`sk_test_…`) keys.

**2 — Register the webhook + get its signing secret.** Stripe Dashboard → **Developers →
Webhooks → Add endpoint**:
- Endpoint URL: `https://dev.utahpros.app/api/stripe-webhook` (Production: `https://utahpros.app/api/stripe-webhook`).
- Events to send: **`payment_intent.succeeded`** and **`payout.paid`** (add `charge.refunded` + `charge.dispute.created` later for S4).
- Save → reveal the **Signing secret** (`whsec_…`).

**3 — Cloudflare Pages env vars** (Settings → Environment variables; **Preview** for dev,
**Production** for main — then redeploy that branch):
`STRIPE_SECRET_KEY`, `STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`. (Optional
`APP_BASE_URL` for Checkout return URLs — defaults to the request origin.)

**4 — QBO accounts** (QuickBooks → Chart of Accounts → New):
- a **Bank**-type account "**Stripe Clearing**",
- an **Expense**-type account "**Merchant Fees**",
- confirm your real **checking/bank** account exists (payout destination).

**5 — Map them in UPR** → `/payments/settings` (admin/manager): click **Load accounts
from QuickBooks** and pick **Stripe clearing account**, **Merchant fees expense account**,
and **Deposit bank account**. Then click **Load from Stripe** and pick the **standard
payout checking account** + **instant-payout debit card**. (Connection flips to
"Connected" automatically.)

**6 — Live test on dev** (Stripe test mode): open an invoice in `/invoices/:id` → **Send
to QuickBooks** → **Create pay link** → pay it with a Stripe **test card**
(`4242 4242 4242 4242`). Verify: a `payments` row (source `stripe`) appears with the
gross + a synced QBO Payment **deposited to Stripe Clearing**; a QBO **Purchase** booked
the fee to Merchant Fees; the invoice balance drops. Then trigger/await a **payout** in
test mode and confirm a QBO **Transfer** (clearing → bank) for the net. Try the **⚡ Pay
out now** button. Re-deliver the same webhook event from the Stripe Dashboard and confirm
it **no-ops** (idempotency).

**Built artifacts (reference):** `functions/lib/stripe.js`; `quickbooks.js`
(`createPayment` `depositAccountId`, `createPurchase`, `createTransfer`, `deleteEntity`);
workers `stripe-webhook` / `stripe-pay-link` / `stripe-payout` / `stripe-accounts`;
migration `20260620_stripe_s3.sql` (applied). **Idempotency:** event id via
`claim_stripe_event` + unique `payments.stripe_charge_id`. **S4 (refunds/disputes):**
on `charge.refunded` / `charge.dispute.created`, reverse the payment + fee Purchase via
`deleteEntity` (not yet built).

## 6. Notes / caveats
- **0 invoices exist** in the DB — all A/R views are empty until one is built. A couple of legacy **job-level payments (~$11.3k)** show in the ledger (no invoice link, not synced).
- The **Item/Class dropdowns + QBO account picker need QuickBooks connected** (they read the live catalog via `qbo-query`).
- I **could not exercise live QBO** from the build environment — the invoice/payment push code follows the proven delete-path pattern and builds clean, but do a **real test on `dev`** (create invoice → add lines → Send → record payment → confirm itemized + applied in QBO).
- **Stripe S3 is built but never run live** (no keys existed at build time). The webhook/payout/fee code follows Stripe's documented API + the proven QBO patterns and builds/lints clean, the migration is applied & verified, but it **must be live-tested per §4** before relying on it (real money: instant payouts + QBO transfers). The external-account list + instant-payout destination behavior especially should be eyeballed on first real connect.
- Stripe `accept_card`/`accept_ach`/`surcharge` toggles already persisted (pre-S3); they gate intent only — nothing charges until keys + a pay-link exist.
- This session (Jun 20): shipped **A (+ New invoice picker)** and **B (Stripe S3, dormant)** to `dev`; `main` not touched (sync on request). Production build passes; changed files lint clean (one pre-existing `loadData` exhaustive-deps warning in `CustomerPage.jsx`, unrelated).

*When the whole initiative is steady-state, fold the essentials into `UPR-Web-Context.md` and delete this file + `QBO-PHASE-2-PLAN.md` (per the Task File Protocol in CLAUDE.md).*
